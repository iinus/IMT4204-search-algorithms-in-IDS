# IMT4204: Search Algorithms


## About
#### BNDM
The BNDM (Backward Non-deterministic DAWG Matching) (DAWG â€“Directed Acyclic Word Graph) is an ultra-fast bit-parallel exact search algorithm first published in 2000 by Navarroet al.(the original paper is available in this directory in Blackboard). The algorithm belongs to the class of so-called skip algorithms. These algorithms are capable of skipping the regions of the search string where the search pattern is impossible to be located. This capability makes them faster on average than search algorithms from the non-skip category. However, the skipping capability introduces a weakness in IDS application of this algorithm. An attacker can deliberately launch specially crafted traffic against a victim employing an IDS with such an algorithm implementedthat would make the skip algorithm run slower than expected (so-called algorithmic attack)
